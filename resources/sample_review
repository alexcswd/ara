I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality.
  The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better.
  My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most.

Product arrived labeled as Jumbo Salted Peanuts...the peanuts were actually small sized unsalted.
  Not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as "Jumbo".

This is a confection that has been around a few centuries. 
  It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts.
  And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.
  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.
  I highly recommend this yummy treat.
  If you are familiar with the story of C.S. Lewis' "The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe" - this is the treat
    that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch.

If you are looking for the secret ingredient in Robitussin I believe I have found it.
  I got this in addition to the Root Beer Extract I ordered (which was good) and made some cherry soda.
  The flavor is very medicinal.

Great taffy at a great price.  There was a wide assortment of yummy taffy.  Delivery was very quick.
  If your a taffy lover, this is a deal.

I got a wild hair for taffy and ordered this five pound bag.
  The taffy was all very enjoyable with many flavors: watermelon, root beer, melon, peppermint, grape, etc.
  My only complaint is there was a bit too much red/black licorice-flavored pieces (just not my particular favorites).
  Between me, my kids, and my husband, this lasted only two weeks!
  I would recommend this brand of taffy -- it was a delightful treat.

This saltwater taffy had great flavors and was very soft and chewy.
  Each candy was individually wrapped well.
  None of the candies were stuck together, which did happen in the expensive version, Fralinger's.
  Would highly recommend this candy!  I served it at a beach-themed party and everyone loved it!

This taffy is so good.  It is very soft and chewy.  The flavors are amazing.
  I would definitely recommend you buying it.  Very satisfying!!

Right now I'm mostly just sprouting this so my cats can eat the grass.
  They love it. I rotate it around with Wheatgrass and Rye too

This is a very healthy dog food. Good for their digestion.
  Also good for small puppies. My dog eats her required amount at every feeding.

The tiny Altoids are great for a quick breath freshening and the small box is great for portability.
  It's full, but compact.<br /><br />I haven't run out yet, and probably won't for a couple months, but I can't wait to buy it again.

Perfect!! They are my favorite because I can season with a variety of spices to exactly suit my tastes without all the salt!
=========[13]==============
I really like this product and taste great with the coffee or tea,
  and I have lost weight by cutting the sugar and replacing it with the honey and Agave nectar.

To my mind, a fine caramel should be creamy and melting.  These are grainy.
  The flavor on these was fine, although a little sweet to my taste.
=========[15]==============
I purchased these little treats as stocking stuffers for our little furry friends.
  Both Yorkies LOVED these treats.  We had to finally buy more since they liked them so much.
=========[16]==============
I am very acustom to spicy foods and this has a very rich flavor.
  Half the bottle was devoted to given people my "not so hot salsa " reactions amazing .
  Worth the money! as for me eating it the title says it all
=========[17]==============
These potatoes are good.  But i don't know if I'd get them again.
  The garlic taste to me was off and strong.  And I LOVE garlic.  Hoping I just got an "off" batch.
=========[18]==============
I really enjoy these low calorie chips.
  They have a good flavor with a good crunch and are crisp.<br /><br />
  I was wondering if when ordering a case of these chips one could order their favorites and not the whole 6 flavors?
  Say just 2 flavors if desired??<br /><br />Its a great product. don't stop manufacturing them. 
=========[19]==============
This product was everything and more according to the advertisement.
  I was totally satisfied with my purchase.
  I recommend to everyone to purchase these chips from this site.
=========[20]==============
I bought these and tried each flavor.
  I could not even finish any bag but the barbecue.
  I really liked the barbecue but all the other flavors were gross.
  And the texture is really like fingernails on a chalk board to me.
  HOw is this the #1 best-selling item? Amazed. Anywho to each his own! Godbless and enjoy.
  But if you are like me and enjoy barbecue just get the barbecue kind!
